"International Brief" is a dynamic and responsive news website developed using Django as part of my final year college project. The platform delivers up-to-date news articles from various categories including General, Business, Technology, Health, Science, Sports, and Entertainment.

The website fetches and displays news headlines using the News API, ensuring users have access to the latest stories updated every hour. It features a clean, mobile-friendly interface designed with Bootstrap, and offers category-based filtering for enhanced user experience.

The site also includes user authentication, allowing registered users to log in and view personalized elements such as their username. Error handling and fallback mechanisms are implemented to ensure seamless content display even when some news items lack images or metadata.

Key Features:

Django-powered backend with dynamic routing and template rendering

Category-based news filtering

Real-time news updates using News API

User authentication (login/logout)

Responsive and modern UI using Bootstrap 5

Graceful error handling and content fallbacks

This project demonstrates full-stack web development skills, API integration, user session management, and responsive design principles.
